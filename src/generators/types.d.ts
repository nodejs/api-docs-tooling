     * The immediate generator that this generator depends on.
     * For example, the `html` generator depends on the `react` generator.
     *
     * If a given generator has no "before" generator, it will be considered a top-level
     * generator, and run in parallel.
     *
     * Assume you pass to the `createGenerator`: ['json', 'html'] as the generators,
     * this means both the 'json' and the 'html' generators will be executed and generate their
     * own outputs in parallel. If the 'html' generator depends on the 'react' generator, then
     * the 'react' generator will be executed first, then the 'html' generator.
     *
     * But both 'json' and 'html' generators will be executed in parallel.
     *
     * If you pass `createGenerator` with ['react', 'html'], the 'react' generator will be executed first,
     * as it is a top level generator and then the 'html' generator would be executed after the 'react' generator.
     *
     * The 'ast' generator is the top-level parser, and if 'ast' is passed to `dependsOn`, then the generator
     * will be marked as a top-level generator.
     *
     * The `ast-js` generator is the top-level parser for JavaScript files. It
     * passes the ASTs for any JavaScript files given in the input. Like `ast`,
     * any generator depending on it is marked as a top-level generator.

     * Then a React generator could receive either the raw AST or the MDX output and output React Components.
     * (depending if they support such I/O)
     *
     * Hence you can combine different generators to achieve different outputs.
