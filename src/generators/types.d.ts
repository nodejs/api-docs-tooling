   * The immediate generator that this generator depends on.
   * For example, the `html` generator depends on the `react` generator.
   *
   * If a given generator has no "before" generator, it will be considered a top-level
   * generator, and run in parallel.
   *
   * Assume you pass to the `createGenerator`: ['json', 'html'] as the generators,
   * this means both the 'json' and the 'html' generators will be executed and generate their
   * own outputs in parallel. If the 'html' generator depends on the 'react' generator, then
   * the 'react' generator will be executed first, then the 'html' generator.
   *
   * But both 'json' and 'html' generators will be executed in parallel.
   *
   * If you pass `createGenerator` with ['react', 'html'], the 'react' generator will be executed first,
   * as it is a top level generator and then the 'html' generator would be executed after the 'react' generator.
   *
   * The 'ast' generator is the top-level parser, and if 'ast' is passed to `dependsOn`, then the generator
   * will be marked as a top-level generator.

   * Generators are abstract and the different generators have different sort of inputs and outputs.

   * Whereas a JSON generator would take the raw AST and output JSON;
   * Then a React generator could receive either the raw AST or the MDX output and output React Components.
   * (depending if they support such I/O)
   *
   * Hence you can combine different generators to achieve different outputs.
